This section of Francois' Git will consist of (quite obvious already) topics of interest. In
other words, this is a place where I can keep notes on anything I want to keep a record of in my
own words.

While it's not an exciting or useful way to use git, it /is/ an excuse for me to just use it and
know it a little better. In addition, it can provide a good way of seeing how my knowlege on a 
topic evolves.
If it looks stupid, but it helps, is it really stupid?
