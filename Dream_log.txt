June 25-26, 2019
1. 	I was in India test tasting foods for a competition. Tibetans were competing as well, but 
	these Tibetans had terrible food (ex. weird white cylinder that tasted like nothing) since
	I assume they were only concerned with Buddhism and matters of the mind. Ironic, since
	they were getting visibly frustrated with me rating their food poorly.
2.	I was watching a Biography about Drake (the rapper) and how he used to be a NBA caliber
	basketball player (he isn't) crucial to winning the Raptor's first championship (not true).
	The montage showed how he played for other teams, and how he was traded to the Raptors for
	"3rd round pick" Antonio Callaway (A football player drafted in the 4th round).
